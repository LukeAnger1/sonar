1. First create a proto file with the API definition. This is the file that will be used to generate the code for the nodes.
2. Generate the client and server code using the following command -
`python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. comm.proto`
3. Write the code for the nodes to run the server and client.
4. TODO: Next steps - a) Instantiate a separate special node that acts as the server and the other nodes act as clients for FL simulation where server anounces its port to the communication server. b) The communication server then sends the server port to all the clients. c) The server listens for get_model requests from the clients and performs federated averaging. The way to do it is by creating different Servicers in the proto file --- one for the communication server and one for the nodes. The communication server will have a method to send the server port to the clients and the nodes will have a method to get the model from the server. Once I do that then I need to quickly figure out how can we align it with our current codebase such that people don't have to write the server and client code themselves. Then the next step is to think about creating a well-defined API and protocol definitions that people can use to launch their own nodes.
